        <div class="text-muted col-sm-12 col-md-8">
          Though these data could be reused in other analyses, these datasets can often be difficult to discover. Data is scattered across general purpose data repositories, specific biomedical data sites, data aggregators, and primary literature. Moreover, the metadata that is used to describe these datasets isn't standardized &mdash; meaning that it's harder to find useful data for particular research.

            The {{site_name}} aggregates <a href="/about#sources"><span v-text="dataSources.length"></span> different data sources</a> together in a <a href="/search">searchable platform</a>, making it easier to find datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
          We also standardize the dataset metadata to a common form, increasing the findability of these datasets. <a href="http://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Schema.org</a> provides a widely accepted format regonizable by major search engines and data portals. While some dataset providers already use this format to describe their datasets, others provide structured metadata in their own format.

            Aggregating together open datasets which have structured metadata is only the first step. Though all the datasets harvested and aggregated on this site organize dataset metadata in the same format, they take advantage of the schema.org standard to different extents. Additionally, since the dataset metadata is provided by the data generators, they vary widely in how much information about the dataset is given and how standardized this information is.

        More work will be needed to be done by the community to standardize how we apply the schema.org format and the vocabulary we use to describe things like diseases, species, and funding institutions.
